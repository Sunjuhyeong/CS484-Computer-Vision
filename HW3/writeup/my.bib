  abstract={Adaptive support weight algorithms represent the state-of the-art in local stereo matching. Their limitation is a high computational demand, which makes them unattractive for many (real-time) applications. To our knowledge, the algorithm proposed in this paper is the first local method which is both fast (real-time) and produces results comparable to global algorithms. A key insight is that the aggregation step of adaptive support weight algorithms is equivalent to smoothing the stereo cost volume with an edge-preserving filter. From this perspective, the original adaptive support weight algorithm [1] applies bilateral filtering on cost volume slices, and the reason for its poor computational behavior is that bilateral filtering is a relatively slow process. We suggest to use the recently proposed guided filter [2] to overcome this limitation. Analogously to the bilateral filter, this filter has edge preserving properties, but can be implemented in a very fast way, which makes our stereo algorithm independent of the size of the match window. The GPU implementation of our stereo algorithm can process stereo images with a resolution of 640 Ã— 480 pixels and a disparity range of 26 pixels at 25 fps. According to the Middlebury on-line ranking, our algorithm achieves rank 14 out of over 100 submissions and is not only the best performing local stereo matching method, but also the best performing real-time method.},
